Recently I've been working on porting an operating system I wrote for class called Weenix from the original i386 emulator it was written on to a Raspberry Pi 3. I've been digging in to a lot of the memory management support code in the process of this, and wanted to write up how it all fits together, since I don't think it's too far off from what a real operating system like Linux does.
