One of my projects for this summer has been to learn TensorFlow. In my experience, I learn best when writing things out and thoroughly explaining them to myself. As a result, I've been working on a series of tutorials walking through different TensorFlow models. Most won't be entirely original, I plan on finding tutorials/code and annotating to a level that gives me a good understanding. Hopefully they might be helpful to others as well. To check out what's been posted in the series, see the [Summer of Tensorflow tag](/tags/SoT.html). Below I've also included a graph suggesting sequences of posts to look through (the groupings I made are only approximate, a lot of models can be applied to a variety of tasks). Red nodes represent posts I hope to write up but haven't yet.

An update:

As you can see below, I didn't quite get to everything I wanted to (which was perhaps an ambitious goal). Although the summer may be over, I hope to continue to post more about deep learning, including some of the things I didn't get to this summer :)
